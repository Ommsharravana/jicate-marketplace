# Phase 1: Deep Research (30+ minutes)

> **Company Mode:** If `--company` flag is set, use the restructured agents defined in `references/company-mode.md` instead of the agents below. The agents below are for industry mode only.

Research is the foundation of playbook authority. Generic research produces generic playbooks. Every minute invested here directly improves the final output.

## 3 Parallel Research Agents

Spawn all three simultaneously. Each agent operates independently and returns structured data.

| Agent | Focus | What to Search For |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| **Pain Hunter** | Industry pain points, operational costs, failure stories, inefficiencies | Firecrawl search for: industry complaints, operational costs, failure case studies, Reddit threads, LinkedIn discussions about frustrations, industry association complaints |
| **Stat Collector** | Hard numbers: market size, error rates, compliance costs, time waste, benchmarks | Government data portals, industry association reports, research papers, IBEF/NASSCOM/sector reports, survey results, regulatory filings |
| **Trend Scanner** | AI adoption in this industry, competitor moves, emerging tech, regulatory changes | News articles, analyst reports, vendor announcements, conference proceedings, funding news, regulatory gazette notifications |

## Quality Gate: Research Depth

Each agent must return at least 10 substantiated data points with sources. If an agent returns generic or shallow results:

1. Re-research with more specific queries (narrow geography, add time range, use industry-specific terminology)
2. Maximum 2 re-research cycles per agent
3. After 2 failures, flag to user: "Research for [agent] returned insufficient data. Proceeding with [N] data points."

## Research Fallback Chain

Try sources in this order. Move to the next only when the current fails or returns insufficient results.

1. **Firecrawl search** (primary) — `firecrawl search "[industry] [specific query]"` with `--limit 10`
2. **WebSearch** (secondary) — broader web search for data the Firecrawl index missed
3. **Context7** (tertiary) — check if any indexed industry documentation exists: `resolve-library-id` with industry terms
4. **Flag to user** — if all three fail, report what was found and ask whether to proceed with limited data or provide more context

## Industry Scoping

If the user provides a top-level category, ask them to narrow before researching. Broad industries produce shallow playbooks.

**Top-level categories that need narrowing:** healthcare, manufacturing, education, retail, agriculture, finance, logistics, construction, hospitality, media

**Good scoping example:** "Healthcare" → "Pharmacy chains in India" or "Multi-location dental clinics" or "Diagnostic lab networks"

Define the target segment clearly before any agent starts researching. The segment definition goes into every search query.

## Insider Knowledge Handling

If the user provided industry-specific knowledge in the interview:

- **New data not found in research:** Use it with attribution like "based on operator experience" — this is what makes the playbook non-generic
- **Contradicts published numbers:** Present BOTH with context: "Industry reports cite X, though practitioners report Y" — intellectual honesty builds more authority than cherry-picking
- **Never silently replace** a sourced stat with an unsourced insider claim
- **Never ignore insider knowledge** — it often contains the most valuable, hard-to-find insights

## Research Output Schema

Each agent returns a structured JSON document. This schema feeds directly into Phase 2 content generation.

```json
{
  "agent": "pain-hunter | stat-collector | trend-scanner",
  "industry": "industry-slug",
  "dataPoints": [
    {
      "id": "PH-001",
      "claim": "Indian pharmacy chains lose 8% of revenue to expired inventory annually",
      "source": "CDSCO Annual Report 2025",
      "sourceUrl": "https://...",
      "type": "stat | pattern | trend | quote | case",
      "targetSection": "hero | problem | bleeding-areas | ai-shift | ai-native | architecture | must-haves | maturity | plan | case-study | prompts | checklist | cta",
      "confidence": "high | medium | low"
    }
  ],
  "queryCount": 12,
  "timestamp": "2026-03-16T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**ID prefixes:** PH- (Pain Hunter), SC- (Stat Collector), TS- (Trend Scanner)

## Research Deduplication

After all 3 agents complete:

1. Merge all data points into a single consolidated document
2. Flag duplicate data points (same stat appearing across agents) — keep the version with the stronger source
3. Assign each data point to exactly one playbook section (use `targetSection` field)
4. If a data point could serve multiple sections, assign to the primary section and add a `"alsoRelevantTo"` field
5. Save consolidated research to `/Users/omm/PROJECTS/jicate-playbooks/[industry-slug]/research.json`

## Security

- Do NOT save raw API responses — only extracted data points and source URLs
- Add `*.raw.json` and `research-cache/` to the project `.gitignore`
- Research files contain public data, but treat insider knowledge as confidential until the human review gate in Phase 5
